// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1. O(1) --> constant time complexity which means that iteration will pass in constant time 
2. O(n) --> linear time complexity which means that iteration will pass n times based on the n size 
3. O(n^2) --> Quadratic time comlexity which means that iteration will pass n*n times based on the n size -when we have loop inside loop-
4. Olog(n) --> logarethmetic time complexity. ex: search binary tree.
